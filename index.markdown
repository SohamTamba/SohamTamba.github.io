During my time at NIT, I concentrated on Performance Optimization, with a focus on *Data Structures and Algorithms*. To summarize: 

1. I **won 3 college-level coding competitions** and our team received an honorable mention at **ACM ICPC**.
2. I contributed to **3 research projects on Performance Optimization**: Efficient Access Control in Hierarchical Group Communication, Approximation Algorithms and Hueristics fo Data Science Tasks, and Efficient FPGA Implementation of Deep-Q Learning. The 2<sup>nd</sup> project was conducted during a research internship at *Indian Institute of Technology Bombay*.
3. I completed **5 courses on Data Structures and Algorithms**: Applied Algorithms, Parallel Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Theory of Computation, and Data Structures. 

---
Regarding coding competitions, our team received an **Honorable Mention at ACM ICPC 2017**, which is one of the most prestigous college-level coding competitions: Over 10,000 teams participated, with participants hailing from almost every reputed Indian university.<br>

I also **won college-level coding competitions** held by reputed Indian Universities. For example, I won Code Heat, which was organized by **Manipal Institute of Technology** and had over **400 participants**.<br>

# 3. Software Development Engineering


I acquired **professional experience in Software Development Engineering** through my time as **Audible** as a *Software Development Engineer Intern* (2020), and my time at **Google Summer of Code** as a *Software Development Mentor* (2019) and *Software Development Engineer* (2018).

---
During my full-time internship at **Audible**, I was tasked with developing a web application that a manager could use to generate a report on his team's performance; I succeeded in creating an application that could generate 40% of the report. It is worth noting that this was my first project related to Web development and I had absolutely no prior experience. Inspite of this, I performed well enough to receive a Linkedin commendation - from my mentor, Tyler McKay - **which should vouch for my ability to learn new skills**. To be perfectly frank, I could not have possibly made the progress I did without his generous mentorship, which included code reviews after work hours and weekend discussions (requested by me).

---
During my time at **Google Summer of Code 2018**, I was tasked with optimizing Julia's Graph Analysis library.After the completion of my project, I continued contributing to Julia Graphs for 1 year. I was then invited to serve as a Software Development Mentor for **Google Summer of Code 2019**. More information regarding my project can be found below in Julia's official blog and my blog.
