# Research/Development Activities

 * **Google Summer of Code** under **Julia Programming Language**

During the summer of 2018, I took part in Google Summer of Code as a student developer and spent 3 months working for Julia Language. My project involved developing optimized **parallel implementations of graph algorithms** in pure Julia and **optimising pre-existing implementations** in the LightGraphs library. The entire experience is documented in my blog.<br>

 * **Undergraduate Thesis** at **NIT Goa**

My final year thesis focused mainly on topics of **Public Key Proxy Re-encryption (PRE) Schemes**. We worked on the topic of achieving efficient Hierarchical Access Control using transitive anti-symmetric PRE, and producing an efficient Threshold Progressive PRE scheme.<br>

* **Research Assistant** to Prof. B. Sharat Chandra Varma at **NIT Goa**

During the summer of 2016, I spent 3 months working in Dr. B. Sharat Chandra Varma's research group to produce an efficient **FPGA implementation of Deep-Q Learning**. The experience involved studying research papers on FPGA implementations of Neural Networks and implementing the algorithm in VHDL.
